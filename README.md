ENG-Tools beta v. 01

by jmg*AT*phasechange*DOT*info

March 8th 2015

These scripts have been created to facilitate research into musical genre utilising the Echonest.

This is a beta release; USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

A full manifest can be found at the end of this readme file. 

To use ENG-Tools you will require the following:

1) An Echonest Developer account, and an API key (from https://developer.echonest.com/account/register)
2) A text file called 'apikey.txt' containing your API key, in the same folder as the scripts
3) Python 2, the 'pyen' library (from https://github.com/plamere/pyen), and the 'matplotlib' library (from http://http://matplotlib.org)

When you have these, proceed as follows:

1) Run 'eng_list.py'. 

This script will connect to the Echonest and generate a directory ('lists/') and a list of all genres (both onscreen, and as a text file in 'lists/..'). It should finish within a few seconds, and will also give you the total number of genres. 

2) A data run will require the running of 'en_genre.py'. 

This will ask how many genres to gather (currently runnong at 1370 in total), connect to the Echonest, and gather data on a maximum of 1000 artists per genre. This will be saved to 'genres/..' ( a directory generated by the sript) as a series of text files, one per genre. It can take over 2 hours for a complete run, and will also write 'date_ratios.txt' to 'data/..' for later use. 

3) To analyse and plot the genres, start with 'eng_first.py'.

This will find the first instances of artists within the genres and writes this data to 'data/first_instances.txt'
Then run 'eng_process_firsts.py' and this will plot the results, and prodcue a graph (in 'graphs/..'). 

4) To analyse artists clustered around single start dates, rather than first instances, run 'eng_cluster.py'. 

This will ask you for a figure, the percentage of artists to be considered as a cluster. 5%, for example. The minimum number of artists that will be considered a cluster, is 3; this is hardcoded. If you choose a percentage that works out at less than 3, the figure is set as to 3. Then run 'eng_process_clusters.py' to plot the results (in 'graphs/..'). 

5) To plot the graph for artists-over-time for each and every genre, run 'eng_multi_plot.py'. It will produce one graph (named with the version nubmer and genre) for each genre file (and place them in 'graphs/..'). A full set of 1370 plots takes around 6 minutes with an i5 processor. Individual genres can easily be plotted in two ways; either run 'eng_multi_plot' having placed only one genre file in the 'genres/' folder, or run 'eng_plot.py'. If doing the later, you will need to copy a genre data file and place it in 'data/..'. Then rename it to 'genre_2_plot.txt'. 

6) 'eng_cdr.py' calculates the ratio of artists with date information to those without, for each genre.

Run this, and it will use the 'data/date_ratios.txt' file from earlier. It writes the output to 'results/eng_cdr.txt'

7) 'eng_prob.py' converts the output from a single genre plot (the results file from 'eng_plot.py'- a genre data file which has been converted to a frequency distribution) to a probability distribution. The purpose of this is to facilitate analysis at a later date. To use this script, copy a genre plot file to 'data/..' and rename it to 'genre_freq_data.txt'. 

8) 'eng_plot_retromatic.py' plots the data gleaned (manually) from 'http://everynoise.com/retromatic.html' This charts the genres of the most popular 5000 songs for every year since 1950 (based on Echonest 'song' genres figures; these are unavailable to the API). A file containg this data can be found in the 'data/' directory, and this is where the script will look for 'retromatic.txt'.
